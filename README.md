# Python RMI Calendar Application


This is a simple Python application that demonstrates a **Remote Method Invocation (RMI)** implementation from scratch, without relying on any pre-built libraries.

The application allows users to control a calendar remotely by:

*   Adding dates to the calendar.
*   Removing dates from the calendar.

### Key Features:
*   **Custom RMI Implementation**: Implements RMI functionality entirely from scratch, showcasing the fundamentals of remote communication in Python.
*   **Calendar Operations**: Provides basic functionality to manipulate a shared calendar.
*   **Simple and Lightweight**: Designed for educational purposes to understand the core concepts of RMI.

### How It Works:
1.  A server hosts the calendar and exposes methods for adding and removing dates.
2.  A client communicates with the server remotely to execute these operations.

This project is ideal for understanding the basics of remote procedure calls and socket-based communication in Python.
